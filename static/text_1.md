<p>This tool gives a quick way to decide how viable a team is on paper (for instance, perhaps if 
you rolled a random team).</p>
<p>Technically, you could also use this for DD1 teams, since we left it possible
to select duplicate heros, although the underlying data is from DD2 so there may be some inaccuracies.</p>
