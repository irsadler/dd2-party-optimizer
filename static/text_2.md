<summary>Build an optimized team...</summary>
<p>This tool will return 4 heroes and suggest 4 of their skills based on selections
like resistances, attack damage, and various skill effects. You can also 
filter hero paths to get a team that you can currently build (if, perhaps,
you haven't unlocked every path yet.) It will also display values for stats that
it optimized for (but it doesn't display all possible information about that hero/path/skill,
which can be found on the DD wiki which you can reach by clicking the Eternal Flame.)</p>
<p>We built the tool around players who are already reasonably familiar with
DD2's party mechanics. The goal is to take the extra reading 
and memorization out of building a team at the crossroads. 
The tool will suggest a reasonable team and (generally) useful skills. However, it 
doesn't do all the thinking for you, so if you put in a list of features that
doesn't make sense in combination, it will spit out a team that doesn't make sense. </p>
